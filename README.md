Assessment for Analytics Engineer Role at Fetch Rewards 


For this assessment, I used the brands.json, users.json and receipts.json file to clean, manupilate and derive insights from the data. I cleaned the data using python in the notebook. Created an ER diagram for the tables and queried the tables using sql. I have mentioned all the queries in the python notebook. You can also find my comments on the data quality and my email to the team at the end of the python notebook.
